Thank you for purchasing the Dungeon Trap Pack.

In this packed you will find 10 unique medieval inspired traps to fill out your level as well as 2 triggers, a pressure plate and a lever. 
All models have textures ranging from 512px on small objects, up to 2048px on large objects, all are PBR textures, and all have animations, though the models
are set up in a way that you can animate them differently within Unity if you need to. 
Below you’ll find more detailed info about each object and it’s animation timings. All animations have been set up beforhand with triggers and can be viewed in the demo scene
by triggering the animations inside the animator window. This is done by opening up the animator window, selecting the parent node of the trap and hitting the trigger while in play mode. 
Example: The sawblade slit traps parent node is DTP_Pre_Floortraps_SawbladeSlit. Selecting the child nodes will not bring up the animation triggers inside the animator window.
